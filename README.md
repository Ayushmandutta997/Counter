# Counter
Counter is a object avoiding and type counting robot. It uses two ultrasonic sensors to recieve reflected signals from the object in front and thus detects it.
To control two BO motors which are responsible for all the movement of the bot i have used L298N motor driver which recieves the signal from Arduino UNO in accordance with 
the object position. Then there is a LED display which gives the account of the two shapes (spherical and cuboidal) as calculated by the difference in values of the two ultrasonic sensors.
